# Overview

-- This is a Javascript-base pokemon search application that consumes an public API
    to display dynamic Pokemon data. 

-- This challenge is from FreeCodeCamp section of their now legacy Javascript algorithms
    and Data Structure certification section from 2025.

# Features

- An search box to find either the Pokemon name or ID number.
- Description of their height, weight, and element.
- A Description of their base along with:

    - HP -> Health Points
    - Attack -> Attack Points
    - Defense -> Defense Points
    - SP Attack -> Speical Attack
    - SP Defense -> Speical Defense
    - Speed -> Speed of the pokemon

# How it works 

1. The user goes to the search bar and type either the name or number of the pokemon.
2. Once they fill out the search bar, they will either press enter or click on the search button.
3. Then infomation of the pokemon will fill the screen.

# What I learned

This help me understand how to fetch data from an API that was given and built a proper search engine.
It also help me understand how to use the **await fetch**, and **reponse from JSON** and once complete, reset the search
to find the next pokemon.
